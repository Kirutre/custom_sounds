## 🚀 How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs 🐛
If you find a bug, please use the [**Bug Report**](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md) template when opening an issue. Be as specific as possible.

### Suggesting Enhancements ✨
Have a cool idea? I'd love to hear it!

### Pull Requests 🛠️
1. **Fork:** the repository and create your branch from `main`.
2. **Set up your environment:** following the steps in the [README.md](README.md).
3. **Branching:** use a descriptive name for tour branch: `git checkout -b feature/destroy-this-extension`.
4. **Keep it clean:** if you change styles, make sure to recompile the Tailwind `output.css`.
5. **Commit your changes:** use descriptive messages (e.g., `feat: add volume slider` or `fix: broken modal on Chrome`).

## 🎨 Style Guide
* **CSS/UI:** I use **Tailwind CSS**. Try to stick to the existing utility classes to keep the design consistent.
* **Code:** keep your JavaScript modular and commented where logic gets tricky.
* **Humor:** a bit of humor in the documentation is welcome, but let's keep the code professional and readable!
